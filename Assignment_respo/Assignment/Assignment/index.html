            <p class="middle-blockpara"> In India, I worked as a software engineer for 4.3 years. As a software developer, I was
                intrigued to learn about mobile app development. As a Post Graduate student at Lambton College in Toronto, I
                am currently pursuing Mobile Application Design and Development. During my time in India, I was in charge of
                assigning tasks to other team members in accordance with their areas of expertise. I began my career as just
                an Associate Software Engineer. Working in a client site during my career start was challenging, but
                adapting to the challenges and improving myself led to my organisation recognising my skills and awarding me
                as Best Employee in my IBU for three quarters, which aided me in becoming an alternative team lead.Being an
                experienced candidate the IT industry will be advantageous. but, Starting a new life as a student is
                difficult. However, I am really eager to master new and cutting -edge technology, which will help me develop
                a successful career.</p>
